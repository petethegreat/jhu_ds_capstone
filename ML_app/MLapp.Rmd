# Intro
Was looking at a job posting that had some stats questions in the application form. Thought I would show my work here, rather than trying to cram it into the answer field.

# Bruises and Burns
This is a pretty straightforward application of Baye's theorem.

Of observed injuries, bruises occur with a frequency of 0.1 and burns occur with a frequency of 0.01. These are the __Prior__ probabilities:

    * $P(bu) = 0.01$
    * $P(br) = 0.1$

We want the probability that an injury is a burn ($P(bu|s)$) or a bruise ($P(br|s)$) given that some swelling has been observed. These are given by Baye's rule:
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(bu|s) &=& \frac{P(s|bu)\,P(bu)}{P(s)} \\
P(br|s) &=& \frac{P(s|br)\,P(br)}{P(s)} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
