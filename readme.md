# Capstone Repo

This repository contains my work for the Johns Hopkins Data science specialisation on Coursera.org.

The capstone project, a text prediction app, can be found [here](https://petethegreat.github.io/jhu_ds_capstone/TextPrediction.html)

Some notes on the model and data can be found in TextPrediction.Rmd, which has been rendered [here](https://petethegreat.github.io/jhu_ds_capstone/TextPrediction.html")
